# Coursera Embedded Systems Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects developed as part of the [Coursera Embedded Systems course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems) offered by the University of Colorado Boulder. The course focuses on low-level programming, hardware interfacing, and real-time systems using the Texas Instruments MSP432 (M2) LaunchPad development board.

## 🛠️ Platform

- **Development Board**: TI MSP432P401R LaunchPad (M2)
- **Toolchain**: ARM GCC, TI Code Composer Studio (CCS), or GNU Make
- **Language**: C
- **Target Architecture**: ARM Cortex-M4F

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific lab or assignment from the course:

- `msp432`: Core driver code and board initialization
- `project1`, `project2`, etc.: Individual projects demonstrating concepts like GPIO, timers, interrupts, UART, ADC, and PWM
- `common`: Shared utilities and headers used across multiple projects

## 📚 Course Concepts Covered

- Memory-mapped I/O and register-level programming  
- Interrupt-driven design  
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)  
- Real-time constraints and scheduling  
- Serial communication (UART)  
- Analog input (ADC) and PWM output  
- Debugging and profiling embedded code  

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Gain hands-on experience with bare-metal embedded programming in C  
- Interface with sensors and actuators  
- Design responsive and efficient embedded applications  
- Understand the hardware-software boundary
